1. What database models do you know?
  - Flat Data Model
      Flat data model is the first and foremost introduced model and in this all the data used is kept in the same plane.
      Since it was used earlier this model was not so scientific.
  
  - Entity Relationship Data Model
      Entity relationship model is based on the notion of the real world entities and their relationships. While formulating the real           world scenario in to the database model an entity set is created and this model is dependent on two vital things and they are : 

      - Entity and their attributes
      - Relationships among entities
      
      An entity has a real world property called attribute and attribute define by a set of values called domain. For example, in a   
      university a student is an entity, university is the database, name and age and sex are the attributes. The relationships among  
      entities define the logical association between entities.
  
  - Relational Data Model
      Relational model is the most popular model and the most extensively used model. In this model the data can be stored in the tables 
      and this storing is called as relation, the relations can be normalized and the normalized relation values are called atomic
      values. Each row in a relation contains unique value and it is called as tuple, each column contains value from same domain and it
      is called as attribute.
      
  - Network Data Model
      Network model has the entities which are organized in a graphical representation and some entities in the graph can be accessed
      through several paths.
      
  - Hierarchical Data Model
      Hierarchical model has one parent entity with several children entity but at the top we should have only one entity called root.
      For example, department is the parent entity called root and it has several children entities like students, professors and many
      more.
      
  - Object oriented Data Model
      Object oriented data model is one of the developed data model and this can hold the audio, video and graphic files. These consist
      of data piece and the methods which are the DBMS instructions.
  
  - Record base Data Model
      Record base model is used to specify the overall structure of the database and in this there are many record types. Each record
      type has fixed no. of fields having the fixed length.
  
  - Object relation Data Model
      Object relation model is a very powerful model but coming to itâ€™s design it is quiet complex. This complexity is not problem
      because it gives efficient results and widespread with huge applications. It has a feature which allows working with other models
      like working with the very known relation model.

  - Semi structured Data Model
      Semi structured data model is a self describing data model, in this the information that is normally associated with a scheme is
      contained within the data and this property is called as the self describing property.

  - Associative Data Model
      Associative model has a division property, this divides the real world things about which data is to be recorded in two sorts i.e.
      between entities and associations. Thus, this model does the division for dividing the real world data to the entities and
      associations.

  - Context Data Model
      Context data model is a flexible model because it is a collection of many data models. It is a collection of the data models like
      object oriented data model, network model, semi structured model. So, in this different types of works can be done due to the
      versatility of it. Therefore, this support different types of users and differ by the interaction of users in database and also
      the data models in DBMS brought a revolutionary change in industries by the handling of relevant data. The data models in DBMS are
      the systems that help to use and create databases, as we have seen there are different types of data models and depending on the
      kind of structure needed we can select the data model in DBMS.
